# Choice Dialogue System Project
 My VN-style dialogue system I made in Unity

This is a test dialogue system I made over the course of about a month or so. I had to mix a few different ideas together to create this, because there were no tutorials that were both plugin-free and up to date.

In the end I got it working, but it isn't very visually impressive.
