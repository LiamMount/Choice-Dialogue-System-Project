# Choice Dialogue System Project
 My VN-style dialogue system I made in Unity

This is a test dialogue system I made over the course of about a month or so. I had to mix a few different ideas together to create this, because there were no tutorials that were both plugin-free and up to date.

In the end I got it working, but it isn't very visually impressive just yet.

A video showing off the functionality can be found here:

// Also, chances are this system could be improved by separating the normal dialogue nodes and choice dialogue nodes into their own subclasses of a sort of "Master" dialogue class. I will likely get around to trying this in the near future.
